# Everyone reviews code at CYF

Mentors and trainees all review code, and collaborate on improving code quality. We are all helping each other to talk, write, and think about code more clearly.

We are not reviewing code as if we were to merge this PR into production; we are opening a technical conversation for the purpose of insight and development.

## Key points:

1. Ask questions instead of making statements:

   **YES:** "Is there another element you could use to group a set of fields in a form? Why might someone use a different element in a form?"
   **NO:** "Use fieldset not divs"

2. Encourage simplicity, clarity, and precision:

   **YES** "There are 15,0000 files in this changelist. Which files should be reviewed?"
   **NO** "It doesn't matter; I can try to figure out what you meant."

3. Respect everyone's work and time:

   **YES** "I think there's some more to do here. Thanks for sharing where you're up to."
   **NO** "This is rubbish. Try harder."

## Labels

Reviewers, please add labels (provided) to the PR once you've reviewed. This helps to focus the trainee on the areas they should work on, and gives an overview for mentors on what the whole cohort needs to work on.

## Solutions

**_If you get a 404_**

**Mentors:** Join your Github Team - ask in Slack or look in the pinned posts in the top of your channel.

**Trainees** get solution repos one week later. Ask your mentors in Slack if you are getting a 404.

### Using the Solutions Repo

Solutions repo typically contain:

#### Sample solutions

Solutions are example answers not the only correct answers.

#### Common responses guides.

Everyone is invited to contribute commonly encountered problems, mistakes, misunderstandings, and mental-model errors to our common responses documents.

Use these resources to inform your code review, get unstuck, and improve your understanding.
