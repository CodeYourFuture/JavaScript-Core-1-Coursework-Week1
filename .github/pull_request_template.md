# Notes

- What did you find easy?
All the exercises from the "Exercises" folder were easy to solve. 

- What did you find hard?
I think the most challenging exercise was the magic-8-ball. I had to do a lot of research about arrays and different methods in order to be able to complete the task.  
I also feel a bit overwhelmed with the complexity of the Math library. I need more time and practice in order to explore most of the methods and the properties in order to understand how it works. 

- What do you still not understand?
I think all the concepts discussed last Saturday are clear to me, everything was very well explained during the last class. 

- Any other notes?
I struggled running the tests for the currency-conversion exercise. The command provided was "npm run extra-tests -- --testPathPattern 1-syntax-errors" but it didn't work when I tried to run the test. I have changed the test command to "npm run extra-tests -- --testPathPattern 1-currency-conversion" and I managed to fix the error.

Overall, my first experience with JavaScript was better than expected and I really enjoyed going through these exercises.
