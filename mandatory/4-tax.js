  SALES TAX
  =========
  A business requires a program that calculates how much the price of a product is including sales tax
  Sales tax is 20% of the price of the product.

/*
  CURRENCY FORMATTING
  ===================
  The business has informed you that prices must have 2 decimal places
  They must also start with the currency symbol
  Write a function that adds tax to a number, and then transforms the total into the format £0.00

  Remember that the prices must include the sales tax (hint: you already wrote a function for this!)
