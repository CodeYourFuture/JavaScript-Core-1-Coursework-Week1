/*
  SALES TAX
  =========
  A business requires a program that calculates how much sales tax to charge
  Sales tax is 20% of the price of the product
*/

function calculateSalesTax(priceOfProduct) {
  const saleTax= priceOfProduct + (20 / 100) * priceOfProduct;   // calculate the saletax which is 20 % -- 20/100
  return saleTax;
}

/*
  CURRENCY FORMATTING
  ===================
  The business has informed you that prices must have 2 decimal places
  They must also start with the currency symbol
  Write a function that adds tax to a number, and then transforms the total into the format £0.00

  Remember that the prices must include the sales tax (hint: you already wrote a function for this!)
*/

function addTaxAndFormatCurrency(credit) {
  const creditAmount= calculateSalesTax(credit).toFixed(2);  //this round off to two decimal place
  return `£${creditAmount}`;
