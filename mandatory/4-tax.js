/*
  SALES TAX
  =========
  A business requires a program that calculates how much the price of a product is including sales tax
  Sales tax is 20% of the price of the product.
*/

function calculateSalesTax(price) {
  let porcentage = price * 0.20; //we multiply with 0.20 to obtain the porcentage which
  //will be included in the final price.
  porcentage += price;
  return porcentage;
}


/* 
  CURRENCY FORMATTING
  ===================
  The business has informed you that prices must have 2 decimal places
  They must also start with the currency symbol
  Write a function that adds tax to a number, and then transforms the total into the format £0.00

  Remember that the prices must include the sales tax (hint: you already wrote a function for this!)
*/
// let calculateSalestax = calculateSalestax;

function addTaxAndFormatCurrency(price) {
  let finalPrice = `£${calculateSalesTax(price).toFixed(2)}`;
  //we create a new variable and call the previus function and concatenate with £ and
  // .toFixed will give us 2 digits to appear after the decimal point.
  return finalPrice;
}
