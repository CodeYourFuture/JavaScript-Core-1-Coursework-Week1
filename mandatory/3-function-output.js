// My answer: The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

function getRandomNumber() {
  return Math.random() * 10;
}

// My answer: In JavaScript, concat() is a string method that is used to concatenate strings together. The concat() method appends one or more string values to the calling string and then returns the concatenated result as a new string. Because the concat() method is a method of the String object, it must be invoked through a particular instance of the String class.

function combine2Words(word1, word2) {
  return word1.concat(word2);
}

function concatenate(firstWord, secondWord, thirdWord) {
  return firstWord.concat(" ", secondWord.concat(" ", thirdWord));
  // Write the body of this function to concatenate three words together.
  // Look at the test case below to understand what this function is expected to return.
}

console.log(concatenate("code", "your", "future"));
console.log(concatenate("I ", "like ", "pizza"));
