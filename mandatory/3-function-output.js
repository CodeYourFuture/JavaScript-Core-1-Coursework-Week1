// Add comments to explain what this function does. You're meant to use Google!
function getRandomNumber() {
  return Math.random() * 10;
}
//The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. 

// Add comments to explain what this function does. You're meant to use Google!
function combine2Words(word1, word2) {
  return word1.concat(word2);
}
//The concat() method joins two or more strings.

function concatenate(firstWord, secondWord, thirdWord) {
  return `${firstWord} ${secondWord} ${thirdWord}`;
  // Write the body of this function to concatenate three words together.
  // Look at the test case below to understand what this function is expected to return.
