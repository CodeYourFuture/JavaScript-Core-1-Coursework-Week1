// Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1 (exclusive):
// For example: 0.40020936983011146
// Math.random() always returns a number lower than 1.
function getNumber() {
  return Math.random() * 10;
} // The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1)with approximately uniform distribution over that range â€” which you can then scale to your desired range. so the getnumber function multiplies the psuedo random number between 0 and 10 however not 10.

// The concat() method is used to join two or more arrays.
// This method does not change the existing arrays, but returns a new array, containing the values of the joined arrays.
function s(w1, w2) {
  return w1.concat(w2);
}
//I think this function allows 2 strings to be added together and create or in this case return a new string

function concatenate(firstWord, secondWord, thirdWord) {
  // Write the body of this function to concatenate three words together.
  // Look at the test case below to understand what this function is expected to return.
  return `${firstWord} ${secondWord} ${thirdWord}`;
}

//Here, I called the last function.
let threeWords = concatenate("I", "don't know", "what to do here!");

// Here, I'm checking my output.
console.log(threeWords);
