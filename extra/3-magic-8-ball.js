/**

  Let's peer into the future using a Magic 8 Ball!
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball 

  There are a few steps to being able view the future though:
  * Ask a question
  * Shake the ball
  * Get an answer
  * Decide if it's positive or negative

  The question can be anything, but the answers are fixed,
  and have different levels of positivity or negativity.

  Below are the possible answers:

  ##Â Very positive
    It is certain.
    It is decidedly so.
    Without a doubt.
    Yes - definitely.
    You may rely on it.

  ## Positive
    As I see it, yes.
    Most likely.
    Outlook good.
    Yes.
    Signs point to yes.

  ## Negative
    Reply hazy, try again.
    Ask again later.
    Better not tell you now.
    Cannot predict now.
    Concentrate and ask again.

  ## Very negative
    Don't count on it.
    My reply is no.
    My sources say no.
    Outlook not so good.
    Very doubtful.
*/

// This should log "The ball has shaken!"
// and return the answer.

//Created array will all possible answers below.
// INCOMPLETE NEED HELP.

let possibleAnswers = [
  // Very Positive

// Below is a variable to store a random answer which is found using  math.floor & math.random methods, .length is used so it knows to chose a number between the beginning and end of the length of the array. I need a better understanding of why we are using math.floor (The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.), but I still don't understand why it is specifically required here.

let randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleAnswers.length);

console.log("The ball has shaken!");
console.log(randomValue);

  let index = possibleAnswers.indexOf(answer);

    return "very positive";
  } else if (index >= 5 && index < 10) {
    return "positive";
  } else if (index >= 10 && index < 15) {
