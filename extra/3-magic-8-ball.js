/**

  Let's peer into the future using a Magic 8 Ball!
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball 

  There are a few steps to being able view the future though:
  * Ask a question
  * Shake the ball
  * Get an answer
  * Decide if it's positive or negative

  The question can be anything, but the answers are fixed,
  and have different levels of positivity or negativity.

  Below are the possible answers:

  ##Â Very positive
    It is certain.
    It is decidedly so.
    Without a doubt.
    Yes - definitely.
    You may rely on it.

  ## Positive
    As I see it, yes.
    Most likely.
    Outlook good.
    Yes.
    Signs point to yes.

  ## Negative
    Reply hazy, try again.
    Ask again later.
    Better not tell you now.
    Cannot predict now.
    Concentrate and ask again.

  ## Very negative
    Don't count on it.
    My reply is no.
    My sources say no.
    Outlook not so good.
    Very doubtful.
