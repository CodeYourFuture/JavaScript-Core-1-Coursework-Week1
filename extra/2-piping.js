/*
  PIPING FUNCTIONS
  ================
  1. Write 3 functions:
  - one that adds 2 numbers together
  - one that multiplies 2 numbers together
  - one that formats a number so it's returned as a string with a £ sign before it (e.g. 20 -> £20)

  2. Using the variable startingValue as input, perform the following operations using your functions all
  on one line (assign the result to the variable badCode):
  - add 10 to startingValue
  - multiply the result by 2
  - format it
  
  3. Write a more readable version of what you wrote in step 2 under the BETTER PRACTICE comment. Assign
  the final result to the variable goodCode
*/

function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;

}
add(1, 3);

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;

}
multiply(2, 3);

function format(number) {
    return "£" + number; 

}
format(16);

const startingValue = 2

// Why can this code be seen as bad practice? Comment your answer.
let badCode = "£" + (startingValue + 10) * 2;

// This is bad practice because all written in one line and difficult to understand and possibly debugging.

/* BETTER PRACTICE */

let adding = 10 + startingValue;
let timing = adding * 2;
let goodCode = "£" + timing;
