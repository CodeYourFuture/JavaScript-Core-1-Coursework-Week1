/*
  PIPING FUNCTIONS
  ================
  1. Write 3 functions:
  - one that adds 2 numbers together
  - one that multiplies 2 numbers together
  - one that formats a number so it's returned as a string with a £ sign before it (e.g. 20 -> £20)

  2. Using the variable startingValue as input, perform the following operations using your functions all
  on one line (assign the result to the variable badCode):
  - add 10 to startingValue
  - multiply the result by 2
  - format it
  
  3. Write a more readable version of what you wrote in step 2 under the BETTER PRACTICE comment. Assign
  the final result to the variable goodCode
*/

function add(numA, numB) {
  return numA + numB;
}

function multiply(numA, numB) {
  return numA * numB;
}

function format(numA) {
  return `£${numA}`;
}

const startingValue = 2;

// Why can this code be seen as bad practice? Comment your answer.
let badCode = format(multiply(add(startingValue, 10), 2));
// this is a bad practice as it makes lots confusion and its not east to read.

/* BETTER PRACTICE */

let goodCode = format((startingValue + 10) * 2);
const added2 = add(startvalm, 2);
const multiplied10 = added2 * 10;
const goodcode = format * multiplied10;
