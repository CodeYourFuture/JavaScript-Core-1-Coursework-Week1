// Start by creating a variable `message`
let message1 = "My name is ";

let message2 = " and my name is ";

let message3 = " characters long";

let name = "Murat";

let message = message1 + name + message2 + name.length + message3;

// below method seems easier
// let message = `My name is ${name} and my name is ${name.length} characters long`; 
console.log(message);
