// Start by creating a variable `message`
let name = "Monique";
let nameLength = name.length; 

//Yours
console.log(`My name is ${name} and my name is ${name.length} characters long`);

//This is fine but remember you already made a varible for nameLength, so try to use as well ;)
console.log(`My name is ${name} and my name is ${nameLength} characters long`);
