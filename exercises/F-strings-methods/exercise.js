// Start by creating a variable `message`
let greetingstart ="Hello my name is ";
let myName = "Nonye";
let nameLength = myName.length;// the length of the character of myName

let greeting = `${greetingstart} ${myName} and my name is ${nameLength} character long.` // using interpolation to combine Hello my name is Nonye and the length of the character of myName 
console.log(greeting);//logs Hello my name is Nonye
