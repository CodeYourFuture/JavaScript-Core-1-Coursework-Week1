// Start by creating a variable `message`

//Storing my name in a variable
var myName = "Amanda";

//Storing the length of my name in another variable
var myNameLength = myName.length;

var message = "My name is " + myName + " and my name is " + myNameLength + " characters long.";

//Logging to the console
console.log(message);
