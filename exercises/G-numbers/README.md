The next data type we will learn is **number**.

Unlike strings, numbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes.

```js
const age = 30;
```

You can use mathematical operators to caclulate numbers:

```js
const sum = 10 + 2; // 12
const product = 10 * 2; // 20
const quotient = 10 / 2; // 5
const difference = 10 - 2; // 8
```

## Exercise

- Create two variables `numberOfStudents` and `numberOfMentors`
- Log a message that displays the total number of students and mentors

## Expected result

```
Number of students: 15
Number of mentors: 8
Total number of students and mentors: 23
```
