console.log("Hello world");

//* Try to `console.log()` something different. For example, 'Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!'.
console.log('Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!');

// * Try to console.log() several things at once.
let greeting = "Hello";
let firstName = "Kara";
console.log(`${greeting} ${firstName}`);
